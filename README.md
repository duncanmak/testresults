Human readable display of Mono Jenkins logs.

To set up this project, run:

    npm install -g typescript
    make npm

Then to build, run:

    make

Site will be installed into `install/`. Open `install/index.html` in a web browser.

To test:

* Because of a web browser security feature called CORS, the files from Jenkins this web app loads can only be loaded if the app is being served from jenkins.mono-project.com. This means if you want to test the app locally, you will need to disable CORS temporarily. I suggest using the [CORS toggle plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/omcncfnpmcabckcddookmnajignpffnh?hl=en) for Chrome.

* Adding `#!debug` to the URL will run in a debug mode which prints verbose information to the js console.
